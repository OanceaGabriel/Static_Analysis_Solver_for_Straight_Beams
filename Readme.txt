Project Title: Beam Analysis Solver

Description:
The Beam Analysis Solver is a software tool designed to perform static analysis on beams subjected to shear forces and bending moments.
It calculates internal forces, draws shear force and bending moment diagrams, and provides essential beam section properties
such as the center of mass and moment of inertia. The primary challenge addressed by this project is transitioning from a traditional analytical solution,
typically solved manually, to an algorithmic approach implemented within software.

Features:

Static Analysis: The solver calculates internal forces within the beam caused by applied loads, including shear forces and bending moments.
Diagram Generation: It generates graphical representations of shear force and bending moment diagrams, aiding in visualizing the distribution of forces along the beam.
Beam Section Properties: Using beam section dimensions, the solver computes properties such as the center of mass and moment of inertia, crucial for understanding beam behavior under load.
Algorithmic Approach: The solver employs algorithms to perform calculations traditionally done manually, enabling efficient and accurate analysis of straight beam structures.
User Interface: Although not explicitly mentioned, a user interface might be included to input beam geometry, applied loads, and other parameters, enhancing usability.
Usage:

Input beam dimensions and material properties.
Specify applied loads including shear forces and bending moments.
Run the solver to calculate internal forces and generate diagrams.
View generated diagrams and computed beam properties.
Analyze results to understand beam behavior and structural integrity.
Technologies:
The solver is implemented using Python, leveraging libraries for mathematical computations and graphical plotting.
