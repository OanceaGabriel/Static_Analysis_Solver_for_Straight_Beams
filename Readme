The task for this project is to design a solver that can make a static analysis for beams
loaded with shear forces and bending moments, calculating the internal forces, drawing
the shear force and bending moment diagrams. Also using the beam section the solver
must calculate the center of mass, the moment of inertia. The biggest challenge here is
transforming a material resistance problem from analytic (solved on paper) to an
algorithmic approach.
